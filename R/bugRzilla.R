#' bugRzilla: A package to interact with Bugzilla.
#'
#' Interact as a user with a bugzilla site, by default R-project.
#' Download data associated with bugs, comments, attachments, history or post a
#' new bug.
#'
#' When reporting a bug we hope to get something fixed for all and help the maintainers.
#' However, it also means more work for maintainers, so try to minimize their work.
#' Try to minimize the work maintainers need to do by following [Bugzilla recommendations](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html).
#'
#' @section Reporting R bugs:
#' If you want to report bugs in R itself consider reading the brief section
#' R-FAQ has about [bugs](https://mac.r-project.org/man/R-FAQ.html#R-Bugs).
#' Consider if this has been reported on the mailing list (R-devel) or on the
#' issue tracker itself.
